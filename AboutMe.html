            <p>
                I would describe myself as a Christian who has a passion for Software Engineering. I would also say I am a hardworking individual who’s interested in working in the software industry and is willing to give anything a go 
                and put 100% into it, I have a passion for Software Engineering and have worked on personal projects along side coursework with my university As a software engineering student, I am learning new techniques and skills which
                have real-world applications. Throughout my studies, I have faced challenges (with modules like "SE workshop" and "Data Structures and Algorithms") that push me to think logically and work collaboratively with others.

                <p>
                    This has been obtain from several different aspects of life. 
                    Some are from college and University, and some are from my personal persuits both in Manchester and in Liverpool.
                    I have obtained a decient amount of both project ideas and knowledge from my time apart of the Software Engineering Team (SETeam).

                    <br>
                    My passion and fire for IT (Specifically Software Engineering) comes from my love to solve problems. This is because I love it when I have been on a problem for a long time, and then I figure out the solution and it finally works.
                    I think it is the best feeling that a Software Engineer could ever have, and this is a continuous throughout the entire SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Before I had ever discovered the career of software engineer, I loved working with Computers.
                    This could have been taking them apart, re-building them (although sometimes not sucessfully), it was only in college where I found my love of coding through a programming unit we had and from there on I found my passion.

            <h2 id="underline">Volunteering Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have an extensive history when it comes to volunteering. This comes from the Churches I attend and Businesses I've helped out at which includes:

                <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Liverpool One Church</a> (Sept 2025 - Current) - My current roles as a volunteer at Liverpool One Church is Camera Operator, Screens Operator. These are both positions that I love
                    doing as it has given me knowledge, experience and friendships which I otherwise would not have been able to obtain. This is ranges from the basics like what is a ISO and how to set it on a C200 to experiences like
                    me helping at Braveheart Womans Conference at the ACC arena in Liverpool as Stage hands. My time at Liverpool One Church is also expending into running the technical side of the Youth Ministry on a Friday night and at the Young Adults Ministry on
                    the last Thursday of each Month.
                </li>
                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Audacious Church</a> (June 2023 - August 2025) - My experience comes from the role of Vision mixer and AV operator. The were both positions that I Loved working as it not only gave me
                    a friendship group which I honestly could never forget, but it also allowed me to learn more of the production side as this was my first time doing production of this scale in a church enviroment and it was an incredible.
                    Similar to Liverpool One Church I received experiences from these roles that I never would have imagined, This also ranges from helping out the Luminous Womans Converence as both a AV operator and a Video Switcher to serving at
                    Nights Of Fire Conference of which they had pastors from all around the world including David Hall from Revival City Church.
                </li>
                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Isaiah 53 Christian Bookshop</a> (April 2022 - July 2024) - My role here was Volunteer Retail Assistant. This was a position I took up on a Saturday afternoon 10am - 5pm and was one I feel like I learned the most
                    about the more technical side of Business management from. This is because whilst my main duties consisted of stocking shelves, inputting stock and handling customer purchases, I also had the oppertunity to sort the invoices from incoming deliveries
                    work on the Facebook Page (in terms of setting it up and creating advertisements for it) and sending off delieveries for customers which were too far away. Whilst I often miss this place, I had to leave due to me starting my studies at
                    Liverpool John Moores University the following september
                </li>

                <h2 id="underline">Programming Experience </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Python</a> - Which I have utilised in the form of a horrible version of a snake type game, this helped to teach me about the concept of "Sequential 
                        Programming Languages". This was shown by how I needed to do one section of the screen such as the boarder before I allow the user to start the game. I also have a bit of experience with circuit python whilst using
                        the matrix portal S3, This was used in a project which I called weather board, and I used an API alongside a Matrix Portal S3 and a Matrix Display in order to create a weather board which you can see the temperature of
                        which ever city you want.
                    </li>
                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Java</a> - Before I started at the Liverpool John Moores University, I had NEVER touched Java. This meant that I had to learn all of the properties
                                in which came from the this language, I learn't how to create variables and constants alongside classes, and objects (which at the time were new concepts to me), In my second year of University We went into
                                a Module called "Data Structures and Algorithms", This showed me how data could be stored differently and this would affect the Big O notation. I have also (in my personal time) focused on a library called "JFrame" in whch
                                you can create a GUI Which helped me to learn more of the Front end side of the work </li>
                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    <li><a style="font-weight: bold;">C++</a> - My main experience with C++ came with my experiences with both the Arduino Uno R3 and a ESP32. With both of these micro-controllers I have been able to achieve different
                    project which are on a varity of different levels. This has ranged from following a simple blink tutorial online to using a PN5180 RFID card reader to make a workstation availability program in which you can see how many places to work are available </li>
