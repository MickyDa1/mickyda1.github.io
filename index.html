            <p>
                I’m a hardworking individual who’s interested in working in the software industry and
                is willing to give anything a go and put 100% into it, I have a passion for Software Engineering and have worked on personal projects along side coursework with my university
                As a software engineering student, I am learning new techniques and skills which have real-world applications. 
                Throughout my studies, I have faced challenges (with modules like "SE workshop" and "Data Structures and Algorithms") that push me to think logically and work collaboratively with others.
